## Functional

First of all , for this project I will develop a web application that will aim to help consumers find a workout program, they will be able to choose about different programs created by coaches. They will be able to found the program they want to follow by sorting the different programs by date, category,... In addition, they will can follow different coachs and give them feedback/comments and grades, consequently they will get notified when a coach uplaud a new program. 
The consumer should enter his informations (weight, height,age,...) to calculate the number of calories he burn in a session. He should enter the distance he walks, he bikes ... this day to add calories burnt. He will be able to watch his calories infos historic.

Another part of the web application will be the coach part. Coaches will be able to create their different workout programs, giving them a name, different steps (step name, description, descriptive image,sets,reps,recovery time,...). They canreview the different comments and grades given in their programs. Finnaly they will be able to write article that "normal user" should read in their profile.

## Technical

For the client part, I chose to use React Framework coupling it with typescript. I chose this framework for a few reasons. The first one is that I already used Angular, thus I think it is a good idea to discover the other "big" or at least the other competitor of angular to expand my skills. In second hand, I'm planning to do an intership this summer as a fullstack developper in a company that uses React, therefor it's a good idea to have a background in React. I also want to use Typescript with React because I really love the fact to organise JS which is messy language. I would like to structure my code by typing my objects. 

For the server side, I chose to use GraphQL with the Apollo framework. I chose this technology because it is a recent technology that I believe in. The way the api is called and all the optimisation that goes with it confirms me in this choice. The fact GraphQL works with schema goes in the same direction as my client part choice (with typescript). I would have a strongly typed code. Finnaly, I have already some knowledge in SQL database and a bit in No-SQL, so I think it is a good idea to explore a new type of database.
